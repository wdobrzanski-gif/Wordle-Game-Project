In this assignment, I take on the mighty New York Times by creating a version of their hit game, Wordle.

In the project:

- I write Python code that creates a GUI using the Tkinter library, including displaying things to the screen and getting input from the user with event handlers.
- I implement a graphical program using the MVC pattern.
- I write Python code that uses the assert statement to check preconditions.
- I write Python code that raises an exception.
